# Reasoning Router

Routes formal reasoning, cognitive enhancement, and deep analysis tasks.

## Subcategories

### Cognitive Enhancement
```yaml
triggers: [think, mental-models, non-linear, literate-programming]
skills:
  - think: Cognitive enhancement toolkit
  - goals: Process goals optimization
```

### Formal Reasoning
```yaml
triggers: [prove, verify, formal, atomic, decompose]
skills:
  - AoT: Atom of Thoughts (full)
  - AoT-light: Lightweight AoT
  - reason: Recursive decomposition
```

### Universal Frameworks
```yaml
triggers: [universal, multi-scale, holarchic, complex-system]
skills:
  - urf: Universal Reasoning Framework
  - ontolog: Holarchic reasoning
```

### Domain-Specific
```yaml
triggers: [physiology, biology, medical, quantitative]
skills:
  - telos: Teleological physiology analysis
  - qp: Quantitative physiology calculations
```
