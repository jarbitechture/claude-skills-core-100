# Simple Table View Template
# Replace 'your-tag' with the tag you want to filter by (e.g., 'tasks', 'notes', 'ideas')

version: v0.1

filter:
  # Change this tag to match your needs
  # Example: '#project/active' or '#status/todo'
  tag: '#your-tag'

views:
  - type: table
    # These fields will appear as columns in your table
    # Add/remove fields as needed
    order:
      - file.name      # File name
      - status         # Status field from frontmatter

    # Optional: uncomment to limit results
    # limit: 50

    # Optional: uncomment to sort (asc = A-Z, desc = Z-A)
    # sort:
    #   field: file.name
    #   direction: asc

# CUSTOMIZATION TIPS:
# - Change tag filter to any tag in your vault
# - Add more fields to 'order' (e.g., priority, date, tags)
# - Use 'file.ctime' for creation date, 'file.mtime' for modified date
# - Add multiple views by duplicating the '- type: table' block
