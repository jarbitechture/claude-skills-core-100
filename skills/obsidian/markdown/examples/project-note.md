    "Design" : 20000
    "Development" : 35000
    "Content" : 8000
    "Testing/QA" : 5000

## Risk Management

| Performance issues | High | Low | Regular testing, optimization sprints |
| Browser compatibility | Medium | Medium | Early testing, polyfill strategy |
| Launch date pressure | High | Medium | Phased rollout plan, clear go/no-go criteria |

Internal project notes:
- Keep close eye on Marcus's workload - may be stretched thin
- Consider moving blog launch to Phase 2 if timeline gets tight
- David mentioned possible rebrand in Q3 - may affect some design decisions
- Budget contingency can cover small overruns but not major scope changes
