# Prompt Engineering Patterns

Advanced prompt engineering techniques to maximize LLM performance, reliability, and controllability.

## Overview

Effective prompt engineering combines structured patterns, iterative optimization, and psychological principles to achieve consistent, high-quality LLM outputs. This skill covers core capabilities, key patterns, best practices, and production-ready templates.

## Core Capabilities

1. **Few-Shot Learning**: Teach by showing examples (2-5 input-output pairs)
2. **Chain-of-Thought Prompting**: Request step-by-step reasoning
3. **Prompt Optimization**: Systematically improve through testing
4. **Template Systems**: Build reusable prompt structures
5. **System Prompt Design**: Set global behavior and constraints

## When to Use

Use prompt engineering when:
- Writing commands, hooks, or skills for agents
- Designing prompts for sub-agents
- Optimizing LLM interactions
- Building production prompt templates
- Improving output consistency and reliability
